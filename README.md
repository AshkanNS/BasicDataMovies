# Movie Statistics and Data Analysis

## Project Description

This project involves the analysis of movie data focusing on box office collections. The primary goal is to explore and visualize the relationship between domestic and foreign earnings, as well as identify patterns and trends in movie performances globally.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about movies' domestic and foreign box office collections. Key features include:

- **Domestic**: The earnings generated within the movie's home country.
- **Foreign**: The earnings generated outside the movie's home country.
- Other relevant attributes can be added based on the dataset's content.

## Installation Requirements

To run the notebook and reproduce the results, you will need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Any other necessary libraries, such as NumPy

You can install the necessary libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies listed above.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`Statistik o Data om Filmer.ipynb`) using JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook.
4. Execute the cells to load the data and visualize the results.

The key analysis includes:
- Scatterplot visualization of Domestic vs. Foreign box office collections.
- Insights into potential trends between these two markets.

## Visualizations

Several visualizations were created to understand the data better:
- **Scatterplot**: Compares domestic and foreign box office collections.
- Any other relevant plots or findings from your notebook.
